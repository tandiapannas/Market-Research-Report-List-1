<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Log Sets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vented Gas Log Set</li><li>Ventless Gas Log Set</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gas log sets market primarily consists of two types: vented and ventless gas log sets. Vented gas log sets require a chimney or vent to expel combustion gases, providing an authentic fireplace experience with realistic flames. In contrast, ventless gas log sets operate without a vent, using oxygen from the room for combustion, making them easier to install and more energy-efficient.
