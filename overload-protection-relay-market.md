<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Overload Protection Relay Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Overload</li><li>Magnetic Overload</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The overload protection relay market consists of two primary types: thermal overload relays and magnetic overload relays. Thermal overload relays operate based on heat generation from current flow, providing protection by tripping when excessive heat is detected, typically suited for motor applications. In contrast, magnetic overload relays utilize electromagnetic principles to respond quickly to overcurrent conditions, providing more immediate protection. Both types are essential for safeguarding electrical motors and equipment, enhancing operational reliability and preventing damage due to overloads.</p></p>
